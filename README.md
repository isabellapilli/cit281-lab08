## LAB 8

```markdown
Lab Goals and Outcomes:

1.  Create lab file and initialize Node.js folder
2.  Install node-fetch package
3.  Add fastify starter code
4.  Add fastify and node-fetch require statements
5.  Fetch JSONPlaceholder data

```

### Technologies Used:
- VS Code
- Terminal

### What I Learned:
In this lab I was able to create a file that requires the standard fastify 
import statements from past projects that declares a constant variable fastify, 
imports fastify, and executes the imported function and requires an import statement
for node-fetch that declares a constant variable fetch, and imports node-fetch.
